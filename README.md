Gravitate
==================

An application for comparing discrepancies between self-rated skills and publicly rated skills. Our purpose is to visually represent the psychological phenomenon wherein how a person views him or herself vastly differs from the public perception of that person. 

Primary contributors are as follows:

* [Ben Brostoff](https://github.com/BenBrostoff)
* [Drew Teter](https://github.com/mdrewt)
* [Greg Piccolo](https://github.com/scoin) 
* [Katie Reiner](https://github.com/katiereiner)

We have attempted to catalogue our work process using both [Trello](https://trello.com/b/duJtlW7A/grav) as well as the [Wiki](https://github.com/woodchucks-2014/gravitational-force/wiki) page for this repo.

This application was built using Ruby on the Rails. The associated data visualizations are largely a product of the [D3.js library](http://d3js.org/), as well as the excellent tutorials on D3 from [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) and [Scott Murray](http://alignedleft.com/). Our project was deployed using Heroku and can be found [here](http://thawing-dusk-8940.herokuapp.com/).  

We encourage open source contributions, questions and comments.
